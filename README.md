**TASK 1**
***Project [Portfolio Website]***
The website typically includes an About page that introduces the creator, a portfolio section with a collection of work samples, a contact page for potential clients or customers to reach out, and sometimes a blog section to provide additional context and insights into the creator's work and process.

Portfolio websites can be customized to reflect the creator's branding and style, and can include a variety of multimedia elements such as images, videos, and interactive features to showcase their work in a visually engaging way.
**TASK 2**
***Project [Unit Converter]***
A unit converter website is an online tool that enables users to easily convert units of measurement from one system to another. This type of website is particularly useful for people who need to convert units frequently, such as scientists, engineers, students, and travelers.

Unit converter websites typically feature a user-friendly interface with a variety of measurement categories, such as length, mass, volume, temperature, and time. Within each category, users can select the unit they want to convert from and to, and enter the value they wish to convert.

The website then calculates the conversion and displays the result in the desired unit, along with a visual representation of the conversion. Some unit converter websites also offer additional features such as the ability to create custom units or save frequently used conversions for future use.
